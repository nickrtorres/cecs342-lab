Today's meeting is (mostly) devoted to finishing up lab assignment 3. You can
find that assignment in
[assignments/03](https://github.com/nickrtorres/cecs342-lab/tree/master/assignments/03).

Consider trying out the optional challenge problem below if you complete the
lab assignment early.

In seminar, you saw how to write a function, [`getIndex`][get], that finds the
element at a given index.  This was implemented using the imperative constructs
that F# offers (i.e. mutability, loops, etc.). Can you write an implementation
that uses immutability and recursion instead? (Hint: use pattern matching to
establish the base case and recursive step(s)).
