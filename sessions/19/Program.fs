// The following is an excerpt from the "CECS 342 - Exam 2 review guide" on BeachBoard.
//
// Study Topics
// - What are first-class functions, and what are higher order functions?
// - What is tail recursion, why is it efficient? Be prepared to translate a
//   non-tail-recursive function into a tail-recursive equivalent.
// - How do the filter, map, reduce, and fold functions work? What is a
//   predicate; a transform; an aggregate; and a combiner?
//   - Demonstrate the behavior and output of a series of higher order function calls.
// - How do persistent lists work, in particular the cons, tail, append, find,
//   and skip functions?
// - What is early vs late binding in closures? Demonstrate the difference.
// - What is the Seq module in F#?
//
// F#
// - Everything from before; but the emphasis will be on using unions and
//   records, not defining them.
// - I will give you questions featuring the Bank Account types from lab. Study them.
// - You will certainly need to apply the filter, map, reduce, and/or fold functions.
// - You should understand the purpose of the Seq module functions.
